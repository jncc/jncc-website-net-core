<div class="ud-unauthorizedclient-error">
    <h4 class="bold color-red">Authorization error</h4>
    <p>Authorization between your environments has failed.</p>
    <p>
        This could be caused by having different deploy API keys configured for each of your environments.
        API keys are specified in the "Umbraco:Deploy:Settings:ApiKey" key in appSettings.json (or equivalent).
        Please ensure that these settings match before trying to continue.
